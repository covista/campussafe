                    <p class="t mt-5 mb-3">
                      This study is designed to evaluate the risks of COVID-19 and community mitigation strategies to prevent COVID-19 transmission among faculty, staff, and student researchers at UC Berkeley.

                    <p class="t mt-0">
                    This study is a critical piece of UC Berkeley’s plans to understand the safety of returning to campus for faculty, staff, and students in the fall, as well as contributing to developing and improving public health strategies to mitigate transmission of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19), including personal protective measures, environmental surface cleaning, adaptive surveillance systems to detect infectious disease, and social distancing during campus activities.

                    <p class="t mt-5 mb-3">
                        First, take our screening survey here. If you are eligible for the study, we’ll ask you to sign some paperwork, take a baseline questionnaire that will take about 30 minutes, and go to University Health Services to have some specimens collected (an oral/nasal swab or saliva collection and blood draw). Then you’ll officially be enrolled.

                    <h3 class="h-3"> Who is conducting the study? </h3>
                    <p class="t mt-5 mb-3">
                        The study is being conducted by a team of investigators at the University of California, Berkeley. The study is led by Maya Petersen, MD, PhD, Associate Professor in the Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health and Art Reingold, MD, PhD, Professor in the Division of Epidemiology and Biostatistics, School of Public Health. In addition, the research team includes: Drs. Guy Nicolette and Anna Harte from University Health Services; Drs. Jennifer Doudna and Fyodor Urnov from the Innovative Genomics Institute; and Laura Packel, PhD, Lauren Hunter, MPH and Shelley Facente, MPH, from the School of Public Health. We’re also working closely with people from the City of Berkeley Public Health Division, and UC Berkeley’s Division of Computing, Data Science, and Society.

                    <h3 class="h-3"> Will individual results be communicated to study participants? </h3>
                    <p class="t mt-5 mb-3">
                        University Health Services will notify you of the results of your testing for current SARS-CoV-2 infection (the oral/nasal swab or saliva collection) within a week of the specimens being collected. The results of serological testing (using the blood specimen to look for antibodies which may indicate past infection with COVID-19) will be provided at the end of the study, since that is when we will actually test the blood specimens for antibodies. 
                    </p>

                    <h3 class="h-3"> What happens after I enroll? </h3>
                    <p class="t mt-5 mb-3">
                      We plan to enroll 1,000 essential workers at UC Berkeley to participate in the study. After they complete the baseline survey and have specimens collected, participants will be asked to take their temperature every morning, and complete a daily survey (less than 3 minutes of time) about any symptoms or risks for exposure to COVID-19. At the end of the summer the study will end, and then participants will be asked to take one last 30-minute survey and have an oral/nasal swab or saliva collection and blood draw once more at University Health Services.
                    </p>

                    <p class="t mt-0">
                      Some people may be asked to go to University Health Services for an additional specimen collection (oral or nasal) for COVID-19 testing during the summer. This will only happen up to 3 extra times, and would be for anyone who reports symptoms or close exposure to someone who is infected, or by random selection.
