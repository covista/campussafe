        <h1 class="h-2"><font color="#1d398f">Safe Campus App: Frequently Asked Questions</font></h1>
		<br>
        <h5 class="h-5">If you have questions not answered below, call/text us at 650-242-5916 or <a href="mailto:safecampus@berkeley.edu">safecampus@berkeley.edu</a>.</h5>
		<br>
		<br>
		<br>
		<h3 class="h-3"><font color="#1d398f"> The app doesn't seem to really do anything. Is it me?</font></h3>
		  <p>
              No, that's right! The app is designed to collect location data in the background. You don't have to do anything other than clicking on the daily notification you receive, to keep the app active behind the scenes. The good news is, by doing that you have a chance to claim 10 entries per day for our weekly drawing for a $100 gift card! 
          </p>
		 <br>
		<h3 class="h-3"><font color="#1d398f"> Who is going to see my location data? Is it confidential?</font></h3>
		  <p>
              Location data collected via this app first goes to the app developer (Mobius Logic), who stores it on a secure server (a cloud-based service composed of two layers: layer 1 is a SQL database and layer 2 is a mongoDB database that is encrypted and highly secured). <ul>The data sent to Mobius Logic do not include your name and contact information.</ul> All your information is instead  identified with a random code. A key linking your name and contact information to this random code will be stored indefinitely on a separate, secure digital platform that is approved to store sensitive information. This key will only be accessible to selected study personnel. About once a week, Mobius Logic will transmit your location data to study personnel using Transport Layer Security (TLS) standard protocols adopted by the industry for encrypting Internet traffic, and study personnel will use the random code in your data to link it to the rest of your study data, which will allow only those study data to identify you. Study personnel are strictly bound by confidentiality rules and have been trained in confidentiality and protection of human subjects before beginning work on this study.
          </p>		  
		 <br>
		 <h3 class="h-3"><font color="#1d398f"> What location data does the app collect?</font></h3>
		  <p>
              The app continuously collects location data about your activity location, and daily activity-travel patterns. Data points include time-stamped longitude, latitude, speed, altitude, heading, vertical accuracy (on some phones), and horizontal accuracy. Data will be collected every 1 to 20 minutes throughout the study for as long as you have location data enabled on your phone, which you can change according to the instructions in the question below.
          </p>		  
		 <br>
		 <h3 class="h-3"><font color="#1d398f"> I accidentally told the app not to always collect my location data. How can I fix that?</font></h3>
		  <p>
              If you have an iPhone, go to "Settings," then "Privacy," then "Location Services," then scroll down to "Safe Campus" and click on it to change the setting to allow location access <b><i>Always</i></b>.<br>
			  If you have an Android, <font color="red"> this still needs info</font>.
          </p>		  
		 <br>
		<h3 class="h-3"><font color="#1d398f"> How do I keep the app running in the background?</font></h3>
		  <p>
              Make sure your location data is set to "Always" be collected (see the answer to the question above for how to do that), and click on the daily notification you receive, which keeps the app active behind the scenes (if you don't interact every day or so, it becomes de-prioritized in the background). That's it! 
          </p>
		 <br>
		 <h3 class="h-3"><font color="#1d398f"> I've changed my mind. How do I stop the app from collecting my location data?</font></h3>
		  <p>
              If you have an iPhone, go to "Settings," then "Privacy," then "Location Services," then scroll down to "Safe Campus" and click on it to change the setting to allow location access <b><i>Never</i></b>.<br>
			  If you have an Android, <font color="red"> this still needs info</font>.<br>
			  You can always change the setting back if you want to start location tracking again.<br>
			  You are also allowed to delete the app from your phone at any time, and this will stop it from collecting any data on you.
          </p>		
		  <br>
		 <h3 class="h-3"><font color="#1d398f"> I'm not receiving push notifications each day. How do I fix that? </font></h3>
		  <p>
              If you have an iPhone, go to "Settings," then "Notifications," then scroll down to "Safe Campus" and click on it to change the settings. You should toggle the button next to "Allow Notification" so it's green, and then you can choose whether you want alerts on your lock screen, in the notification center, or as banners (you should allow at least one of those, so you receive the notification and remember to click on it to claim your drawing entries and keep the app active.<br>
			  If you have an Android, <font color="red"> this still needs info</font>.
          </p>				  
		  <br>
		  <h3 class="h-3"><font color="#1d398f"> Now that I've installed the Safe Campus app, do I need to keep TestFlight on my iPhone?</font></h3>
		  <p>
              Yes, you need to keep TestFlight installed on your phone (and you should have push notifications for TestFlight enabled, which you can do following the directions in the answer above). TestFlight is used to push out any new versions of this beta app to you, to fix bugs or release new features. Without TestFlight you may have a bug that never gets fixed on your version of the Safe Campus app. Once the study is done, we will let you know and you can delete both this app and TestFlight if you would like.
          </p>				  
		  <br>
		  		  <h3 class="h-3"><font color="#1d398f"> Now that I've installed the Safe Campus app, do I need to keep Microsoft's App Center on my Android?</font></h3>
		  <p>
              Yes, you need to keep App Center installed on your phone (and you should have push notifications for App Center enabled, which you can do following the directions in the answer two questions above). App Center is used to push out any new versions of this beta app to you, to fix bugs or release new features. Without App Center installed you may have a bug that never gets fixed on your version of the Safe Campus app. Once the study is done, we will let you know and you can delete both this app and App Center if you would like.
          </p>				  
		  <br>
		  <h3 class="h-3"><font color="#1d398f"> My app crashed, what do I do?</font></h3>
		  <p>
              You can send a crash report through TestFlight (iPhones) or Microsoft's App Center (Android). <font color="red"> More info needed here from Christian.</font>
          </p>				  
		  <br>
		 <h3 class="h-3"><font color="#1d398f"> I found a bug in the app. How do I report it?</font></h3>
		  <p>
              You can send an email to the developer, Mobius Logic: <font color="red"><a href="mailto:">email here</a></font>. 
          </p>	
		   <br>
		 <h3 class="h-3"><font color="#1d398f"> I want to speak with a study coordinator, how do I do that?</font></h3>
		  <p>
              If you have any questions or concerns about this study, you may contact study coordinator Laura Packel at (650) 242-5916 or <a href="mailto:safecampus@berkeley.edu">safecampus@berkeley.edu</a>. If you have any questions or concerns about your rights and treatment as a research subject, you may contact the office of UC Berkeley's Committee for Protection of Human Subjects, at (510) 642-7461 or <a href="mailto:subjects@berkeley.edu">subjects@berkeley.edu</a>.
