This study is designed to evaluate the risks and community mitigation
strategies to prevent COVID-19 transmission among faculty, staff and
students at UC Berkeley.

This study is a critical piece of UC Berkeley’s plans to understand
the safety of returning to campus for students in the fall, as well as
contributing to developing and improving public health strategies to
mitigate transmission of SARS-CoV-2, including personal protective
measures, environmental surface cleaning, adaptive surveillance
systems to detect infectious disease, and social distancing within
campus housing and during campus activities.

[Currently, we are inviting undergraduate students currently enrolled
at UC Berkeley with plans to reside in Alameda or Contra Costa
counties to participate.](students)

This website will be updated when
recruitment expands to other groups of people.
