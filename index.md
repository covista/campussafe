This study is designed to evaluate the risks and community mitigation
strategies to prevent COVID-19 transmission among faculty, staff and
students at UC Berkeley.

This study is a critical piece of UC Berkeley’s plans to understand
the safety of returning to campus for students in the fall, as well as
contributing to developing and improving public health strategies to
mitigate transmission of SARS-CoV-2, including personal protective
measures, environmental surface cleaning, adaptive surveillance
systems to detect infectious disease, and social distancing within
campus housing and during campus activities.

[Currently, we are inviting undergraduate students currently enrolled
at UC Berkeley with plans to reside in Alameda or Contra Costa
counties to participate.](students)

This website will be updated when recruitment expands to other groups of people.

Your privacy is very important to us. Any personal contact information you provide for the screening questionnaire will be stored securely, used only for secure research-related communication with you, and not shared with anyone outside of the study investigators at UC Berkeley.

## Will individual results be communicated to study participants?

Participants will be individually notified by study investigators of their results of current SARS-CoV-2 infection (positive, negative or inconclusive). Individual results for past SARS-CoV-2 infection using antibody testing will not be returned to participants.

For results of current infection, participants will be provided educational materials from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) about what the results mean and recommendations for what to do if they test positive or are feeling sick ([see CDC recommendations](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/index.html)). Current SARS-CoV-2 viral testing results, including positive, negative and inconclusive test results, will also be reported to the California Department of Public Health as currently mandated under the authority of California Health and Safety Code Sections 101040, 101085, and 120175.

Also see the California Department of Public Health [website](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CID/DCDC/Pages/Immunization/ncov2019.aspx) and the CDC website ([https://www.coronavirus.gov](https://www.coronavirus.gov)) for more information.
