# Join the Berkeley Safe Campus Initiative - Students

## How do I get started?

Volunteers are asked to consent to enrollment for initial screening here. After enrollment, study participants complete a health assessment questionnaire and provide contact information, basic demographic information (including age, race, ethnicity, sex, occupation), and other information about their immediate household members.

## What happens after screening?
The investigators will randomly select 1,000 UC Berkeley undergraduates from the study participants who provided screening information to participate in the study for completion of further questionnaires, and testing for COVID-19 at University Health Services on the UC Berkeley campus. 

Sampling and data collection from each participant will take place up to 5 times over 2-3 months.

If you are interested in participating, [please go here]().

Your privacy is very important to us. Any personal contact information you provide for the screening questionnaire will be stored securely, used only for secure research-related communication with you, and not shared with anyone outside of the study investigators at UC Berkeley.
